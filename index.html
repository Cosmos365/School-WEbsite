      <p1>The history behind the name
        Our school is named TULLIALLAN Primary School. This name reflects the local historic and aesthetic significance to the City of Casey and to the students and families that live in the school’s local neighbourhood. Tulliallan is highly significant in history and in a regional context as it is associated with the settlement of the area during the pastoral era of 1850s and 60s, prior to the land being opened for selection. It illustrates the development of cattle runs within the south east part of the Settled District of Port Philip. It has associations with locally important individuals in history, including members of the Rossiter family, Strettle family, James Gibb and Captain Mitchell. The heritage listed ‘Avenue of Elms’ and ‘Shearers Cottage’ is 400 metres from our school site.</p1>

<p1>Since opening in 2017, Tulliallan Primary School has worked in a close partnership with CERES to ensure sustainability is at the forefront of the schools mind. Today, it is more important than ever for educational organizations to recognize the value of providing students with education on sustainability.

  At Tulliallan we see this as an opportunity to give the next generation all the skills and knowledge necessary to handle the social and environmental changes that will occur in the near future. Students are encouraged to gain an understanding of the dependence between humans and the environment where they live. Through sustainability education we aim to provide students with opportunities to learn about environmental issues and solutions that are mutually beneficial to both humans and the natural ecosystem.
  
  Sustainability education at Tulliallan is fun, hands-on, engaging and empowering for students. It allows them to take responsibility for their actions and to contribute their vision for a sustainable future. It enables them to develop knowledge, skills, values and motivations for action, allowing them to maintain their own wellbeing – and that of their community and the planet – in an increasingly interconnected world</p1>
